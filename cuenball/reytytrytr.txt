There are no rankings points available in the Champion of Champions, but it is still one of the most coveted titles around.

Defending champion: Neil Robertson

The second part of the Triple Crown roars into Alexandria Palace in January for what may be the most unique atmosphere in snooker.

It's a non-ranking event that invites the top 16 players in the world only to fight it out for some big money and prestige.

Last year it was won by Neil Robertson, who was close to being unstoppable at times during the season.

Can he go one better in 2023 and become the first player to win eight? Or will one of the richly Chinese youngsters finally come through and win a historic first world corwn for their country?
